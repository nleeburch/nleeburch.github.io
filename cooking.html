    Mayonnaise is actually a very healthy food. 
    If you make it from quality ingredients, mayonnaise can supply you with a good quantity of healthy fats in a tasty way.
    
    Recipe for homemade mayonnaise:

    Time: 5 minutes
    Makes: 1 cup

    Ingredients:
    2 large eggs, at room temperature
    2 teaspoons fresh squeezed lemon juice (or vinegar)
    1 cup of neutral flavored oil (like light olive oil, grapeseed oil, walnut or sweet almond oil)
    A pinch of good quality fine grain sea salt

    Directions:
    1) Gather all your ingredients together. 
    I've found that a sturdy whisk works best and a bowl with high sides will help prevent splashes.

    2) Separate the eggs. 
    Save the egg whites for another purpose (like meringue) and place the egg yolks in a small bowl with high sides.

    3) Pour the fresh lemon juice into the bowl with the egg yolks and whisk them well. 
    Egg yolks contain a natural emulsifier, lecithin, which helps thicken sauces and bind ingredients.

    4) Slowly, a few drops at a time, pour the oil into the bowl while whisking constantly. 
    Once the mayonnaise has started to thicken, pour the oil in a slow and steady stream. 
    If the oil starts to build up at all, stop pouring and whisk the mayonnaise briskly until the oil has incorporated.

    5) If the mayonnaise starts looking too thick, add enough water to thin it to the consistency you like. 
    Add about a teaspoon of water at a time.

    6) Once all the oil has been mixed in, the mayonnaise should be thick and fluffy, 
    with your whisk forming ribbons through the mixture. 
    Season it carefully with fine grain sea salt. Add a small splash of water if you would like a thinner mayonnaise.

    Store your homemade mayonnaise in the fridge in a covered container for 3 days.
