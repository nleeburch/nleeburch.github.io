        Mitochrondia: The mitochondria is an organelle which performs cellular respiration to produce ATP. 
        The quantity and quality of mitochondria depends on the energy demands of the cell in question. 
        Mitochondria have an inner and outer membrane. 
        The inner membrane creates a grill like matrix of cristae (folds) which increases the inner surface area on which chemical reactions can occur. 
        Between the inner and outer membrane is the intermembrane space. 
        ATP is synthesized through the oxidative phosphorylation across the inner membrane's electron transport chain. 
        The outer membrane functions as a mediating wall and the inner membrane is lined with the enzymes (biocatalysts) for oxidative phosphorylation. 

        Oxidation is the losing of electrons via the addition of an oxygen ion and phosphorylation is the attachment of a phosphoryl group 
        to an organic (C,O,H,N) molecule and functions to activate proteins and transmit signals i.e. differences in charge i.e. thermodynamics. 
        For example, the phosphorylation of ADP, adenosine diphosphate (one adenosine, one of four nucleoside building blocks to RNA, and two phosphate ions) 
        results in ATP, adenosine triphosphate (one adenosine and three phosphate ions). 
        An oxygen ion in ADP is bonded with a phosphoryl group to create a third phosphate group. 
        A phosphoryl group becomes a phosphate group when it increases the number of oxygens to which the phosphorous of the phosphoryl group is attached.

        A nucleoside is a component of RNA while a nucleotide is a component of DNA. 
        The chemical difference is that a nucleotide (adenine, guanine, cytosine, thymine) is attached to one to three phosphate groups while a nucleoside is attached to none. 
        A phosphate group is [PO4]3-. A phosphoryl group is [PO3]2-. 
        The oxidative phosphorylation of ADP to ATP in the electron transport chain, then, is the creation of a high energy bond which is released in ATP hydrolysis (addition of water). 
        The product is ADP, the phosphoryl group left over which is converted to hydrogen phosphate ion, and a positively charged water molecule or hydronium. 
        Chemical energy is converted into mechanical energy. 
        The enzyme which conducts ATP synthesis is ATP synthase and the enzyme of ATP hydrolysis is ATPase. 
        Energy is the cycle of phosphorylation and de-phosphorylation or ATP synthesis and ATP hydrolysis, the formation and deformation of a covalent bond. 

        Mitochondria has its own mtDNA of 37 genes which produce 13 proteins which build the electron transport chain, 
        2 rRNA (ribosomal RNA for the ribosomes within the mitochondria that fold the proteins) 
        and 22 tRNA (transfer RNA for the transfer of amino acids). 
        A 14th protein humanin was discovered in 2001. 
        All the other thousands of different proteins for mitochondria are housed in the DNA. 
        mtDNA is inherited only from the mother. mtDNA has a high mutation rate. 
        Within a few thousand years, these mutation are sufficient to distinguish between different human populations.

        Both mitochondrial membranes are made of phospholipid layers. 
        A phospholipid is a molecule composed of a phosphate head and a lipid tail. 
        A lipid is chemically defined as substance which is insoluble in water and soluble in alcohol, ether, and chloroform. 
        The phosphate head is attracted to water while the lipid tail is repelled by water. 
        The outer portion of the OMM contains porins, proteins which are little channels to create a semipermeable membrane. 
        The channel is wide enough to allow passive diffusion, no energy transportation. 
        The OMM also contains lots of different enzymes.

        Because the OMM is passive diffusive, the intermembrane space has a similar molecular concentration as the cytosol 
        or the outer organelle cytoplasm, however there is some difference in the proteins which make up the IMS. 
        Finally, the IMM has no porins. The proteins it does perform oxidative phosphorylation to make most of the body's ATP. 
        Protons build up across the IMM by the electron transport chain. 
        Then ATP synthase does its thang and ATP is generated in the matrix. 
        The matrix is the innermost recess of the mitochondria containing hundreds of enzymes, mitochondria ribosomes, mtDNA and tRNA.
        
        The functionality of a mitochondria determines the life and death (apoptosis) of a cell. 
        They also regulate calcium concentration in the cell and generate heat in brown fat cells. 
        Mitochondria convert food and oxygen into ATP to keep the tank full. 
        The human body can recycle its own body weight equivalent in ATP per day. 
        The biochemical reactions involved in ATP production are collectively termed the citric acid cycle or TCA cycle. 
        The reaction produces a chemical called NADH which carriers its electron to the ETC for ATP Synthesis. 
        Protons build up in the IMS and then flow through ATP Synthase which uses the proton flux to perform ATP Synthesis. 
        The flow of protons along ATP Synthase is the product of the difference in charge between the matrix and the IMS. 

        The ETC is composed of 4 protein complexes which regulate the flow of protons from the matrix to the IMS. 
        The first protein complex is a chain of perfectly distanced and differing electronegative redox centers (low affinity to high affinity) 
        which facilitate the jump of electrons from glucose down the chain to a coenzyme Q molecule. 
        This flow of electrons generates energy and this energy is used to pump protons. 
        The second protein complex transfers the electrons from a by-product of glucose metabolism FADH2 down 
        an increasingly electronegative chain into a coenzyme Q molecule. 
        The coenzyme molecules from complex 1 and 2 donate their electrons to complex 3. 
        One electron is stored for later and the other sent to complex 4 via cytochrome-c. 
        Complex 4 is the end of the electron transport chain where oxygen is converted into water 
        by using the hydrogen in the IMS, thus changing the charge of the IMS 
        and thus requiring more flow of protons from the matrix into the IMS 
        via ATP Synthase whose proton flux drives the synthesis of ATP mechanically. 
        If there is no gradient or charge difference, there is no flow of protons 
        and thus ATP can not be mechanically synthesized.
